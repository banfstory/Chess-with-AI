# Chess-with-AI

My chess game is built in C# with the .NET framework (Windows Forms App), the game allows a player to verse another player or a player to verse an AI with varying level of difficulty. The chess AI uses the Minimax Algorithm that takes into consideration the best scenarios that is made for both the player and AI in order to make the best choice possible. For the AI to make the best move, it needs to take look at all the different moves that can be made using DFS where the difficulty of the AI is determined by how deep the tree goes, it also uses Backtracking in order compare node’s materials as it works it way up the tree.
